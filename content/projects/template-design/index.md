This is a simple sample site easily customized to suit any small business. It's a modified version (blatant rip-off) of Andy Bell's [Learn Eleventy From Scratch tutorial](https://piccalil.li/course/learn-eleventy-from-scratch/) (don't judge me, I paid for the tutorial and I'm going to update it), but it's a great example of what can easily be achieved with the [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator.
