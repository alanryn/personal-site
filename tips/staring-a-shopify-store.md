Thinking of creating a new Shopify site? Here's some advice on how to get started.

Create an account at shopify.com

Get 3 days free trial and then the first month for â‚¬1.
==Tip 1== -- If you think your site will take a lot more than a month to complete and you don't want to pay anything until it's ready then consider creating a free partner account with Shopify, when you are ready to put your store live you can publish the developer site and start paying the full monthly fee from that point. You don't get the first month for 1 Euro but you won't be paying for a store that's not ready.

After your first month you need to switch to a paid plan. Basic should be fine for small operations (24euro p/m pay yearly / 32euro p/m pay monthly)  
You need to select a template for your store (https://themes.shopify.com/), the default is Shopify's free Dawn theme
Tip 2 -- All the free themes from Shopify are the same, just with differernt default settings, in other words you can start with the Dawn theme and turn it into Crave theme by changing the settings in the theme customizer. If you like the inital appearance of any of the free themes, just start there, otherwise use the default Dawn theme.

Stick with the paid themes from the offial Shopify theme store. I like the themes form Archetype, Out of the Sandbox, but any of the paid themes should be reliable. The prices are a little expensive but in return you get theme updates, support and features that may not be in the free themes, so it pays for itself quickly.

Tip 3 -- Do not make changes to the theme code unless it is really necessary, it will complicate the updating to new versions of the theme, let the theme developers do the work for you, they will regularly release code updates, bug fixes and new features. Limit your changes to the theme custonmizer.
If you are making code changes record all your changes (ideally use Shopify's Github integration to track your changes)

Only pay for and/or install essential apps. too many may slow down your site. If the app is offering value and improving your sales and productivity then it will easily pay for itself.Become familar with Shopify's free native apps, especially Shopify Flow, this is a very powerful automation tool that can potentially eliminate the need for some paid apps.

Learn liquid coding and understand adding custom fields using metafields and metaobjects. These can be used to add extra custom fields to your products, collections etc.

There are lots of free resources that expalin Shopify. [Here's a list that I refer to regularly](https://alanryan.dev/tips/resources/).
